Gifsicle
========

Gifsicle manipulates GIF image files. Depending on command line
options, it can merge several GIFs into a GIF animation; explode an
animation into its component frames; change individual frames in an
animation; turn interlacing on and off; add transparency; add delays,
disposals, and looping to animations; add and remove comments; flip
and rotate; optimize animations for space; change images' colormaps;
and other things.
